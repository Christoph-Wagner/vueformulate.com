## Feature requests

Do you have a great idea for how to make this project better? First, consider if
the feature you’d like to add would be applicable to the majority of users of
this project. If so, please [submit an issue on Github](https://github.com/wearebraid/vue-formulate/issues).

## Bug reports

Bug reports are very welcome, first check on [Github](https://github.com/wearebraid/vue-formulate/issues)
to see if the bug has already been reported. If not, please create a new issue.
The more detail you can give to describe the issue the better. Screenshots,
steps to reproduce, and CodePen examples are greatly appreciated, but not
required to submit.


## Pull requests

Pull requests to address bug fixes or feature requests are greatly appreciated.
If you're looking to add support for a new language or modify the available
languages, please [read the Internationalization](#Internationalization) section
below. Other core feature pull requests should be made to the primary repository.

## Documentation

Find a typo in our documentation? Or have a better way of explaining a
concept? Awesome! The documentation lives in a [separate repository](https://github.com/wearebraid/vueformulate.com)

#### For small changes

At the bottom of every page on this site there is a "Help improve this page!"
link where you can submit small corrections.

#### New pages

For any significant changes to the documentation you’re best off forking the
documentation to your own machine and editing it there. When you're done, submit
a pull request.

#### Language support

We’re looking for people to translate these documentation pages! It’s no small
task and would require a higher level of coordination, but if you are a native
speaker with a good grasp of technical english and are willing to contribute
your time to translate this documentation, please [get in touch](mailto:hello@wearebraid.com)!

## Internationalization

All of the locales for Vue Formulate (2.2.0 and later) are stored in the
`@braid/vue-formulate-i18n` package which can be found on [Github here](https://github.com/wearebraid/vue-formulate-i18n).
This is a separate repository to allow for better tree-shaking and bundler
support without needing to include all the locales in the core package.

#### New locales

Adding additional translations of Vue Formualte (currently this is
only validation messages) is a great way to contribute! To create a new locale,
fork the `@braid/vue-formulate-i18n` repository then follow these basic steps:

1. Copy the `src/locales/en.js` > `src/locales/xx.js` (these should be named
with the proper [ISO 639-1 tag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)), and follow the instructions in that file.
2. Copy the `tests/unit/en.js` > `tests/unit/xx.js` and follow the instructions in that file.
3. Add your new locale to the `src/locales.js`.
3. Run `npm install` and then `npm test` to ensure nothing broke.
4. Push your fork back up and create a PR.

We don’t speak your language, so feel free to change and modify the messages to
be as human-friendly to your language and culture as possible. The structure,
grammar, and placement of arguments is allowed to change for each locale. If you
need to add some lightweight helper functions to the `libs/formats.js` file,
thats ok too.

#### Grammar and Typos

Updates to grammar and typos are more than welcome! The package maintainers are
only fluent in English and Italian, so occasionally we may request outside
reviewers to approve grammar changes in other languages before merging.
