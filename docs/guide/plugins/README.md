# Plugins

Plugins are just simple functions that are given access to the Vue Formulate
instance and can extend it. This is most helpful if you want to codify your own
[custom validation rules](/guide/validation/#custom-validation-rules),
[messages](/guide/validation/#customize-validation-messages) or
[inputs](/guide/inputs/custom-inputs/).

:::tip Please share!
Vue Formulate is brand new, so if you publish a custom input plugin on npm or
GitHub and want to share it, submit a [pull request](https://github.com/wearebraid/vueformulate.com/edit/master/docs/guide/plugins/README.md)
or [file an issue](https://github.com/wearebraid/vueformulate.com/issues/new)
on the documentation repository and we'll list it on this page.

## Creating a new plugin

Plugins are just functions that are passed to Vue Formulate when registering and
are then called upon instantiation.

### Simple example

```js
import Vue from 'vue'
import VueFormulate from '@braid/vue-formulate'

// Our first plugin
function myFirstPlugin (instance) {
  // Add a new validation rule
  instance.extend({
    rules: {
      foobar: ({ value }) => ['foo', 'bar'].includes(value)
    }
  })
}

Vue.use(VueFormulate, {
  plugins: [ myFirstPlugin ]
})

```

#### The `extend` method

The instance of Vue Formulate passed to your plugin contains an `extend` method
that recursively extends the instance configuration options. This can be used
to overwrite and add any configuration options.

#### Example autocomplete plugin

A common use case for a plugin is to re-use custom inputs, so as an example lets
create a plugin that exposes the autocomplete input from the [custom inputs
documentation page](/guide/inputs/custom-inputs/#custom-types).

```js
// file: Autocomplete.js
import MyFormulateAutocomplete from './components/MyFormulateAutocomplete'

export default function (formulateInstance) {
  formulateInstance.extend({
    components: {
      MyFormulateAutocomplete
    },
    library: {
      autocomplete: {
        classification: 'text',
        component: 'MyFormulateAutocomplete'
      }
    }
  })
}
```

:::tip Note
In the above code, we use Vue Formulate to register our component by adding it to
the `components` object. This is a convenience, but you are not required to
register the component with Vue Formulate as long as itâ€™s been globally
registered.
:::

```js
// index.js (or where you add your vue plugins)
import Vue from 'vue'
import VueFormulate from '@braid/vue-formulate'
import Autocomplete from './Autocomplete'

Vue.use(VueFormulate, {
  plugins: [ Autocomplete ]
})

```

Of course, the above code could also be bundled up into a tidy `npm` package
and published for public consumption.
